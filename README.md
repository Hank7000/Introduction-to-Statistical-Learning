# Introduction-to-Statistical-Learning

This is a collection of labs and exercises from Stanford's ['An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R'](https://www.statlearning.com). 
Each chapter's labs and exercises are stored in a separate R file. The code is commented, but not sufficient to understand the exercises, therefore downloading the book at the link provided above is recommended. The download is free.
